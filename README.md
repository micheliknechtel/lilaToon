# lilaToon

LilaToon its a tool that I build myself to colorize images automaticaly.

You should run it in Windows and only, I'm using some multi-thread windows functionality. 

The application might ask you to install some old features, just do it and should be fine!

To use the tool you might click in icon art line, and load from the folder images a image that has as
post fixed name "artLine", example kagome_artLine.png.

Once you load the image to be colorized, you should click in the icon colorida, and load  the image kagome_color.png.

Then click in the icon "processar", you will be placed in Shader frame, you must click in he boton Calcular.

That's it ... The code is inside of folder code, which algorithm correspond to a frame that you my see in the software.

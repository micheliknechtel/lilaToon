# What is LilaToon ?

**LilaToon** its a tool that I build myself to colorize images automaticaly.

## OS requirements:
You should run it in Windows and only, I'm using some multi-thread windows functionality. 

## How to install Lila ?
To do so, please donwload the [git project](https://github.com/micheliknechtel/lilaToon/tree/master/LilaToon 
), that has the windows binary **Lila.exe**. In addition, make sure that you download the images to be colorized from [here.](https://github.com/micheliknechtel/lilaToon/tree/master/images)

The application might ask you to install some old features, just do it and should be fine!

## How to use Lila ?
1. To use the tool, you might click in icon **art line**, and load from the folder **images**, a image that has as
post fixed word "artLine", for example **kagome_artLine.png**.

2. Once you load the image to be colorized, you should click in the icon **colorida**, and load the image with the post fixed word **color**, for the previously  take example: **image kagome_color.png**.

3. Then click in the icon **processar**, you will be positioned in the **shader** frame, then you must click in he bouton **calcular**.

>>That's it! The code is inside of folder code, which algorithm correspond to a frame that you see in the application.

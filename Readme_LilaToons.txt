LilaToon its a tool that i build myself to colorize images automaticaly.

You should run it in Windows, it might ask you to install some old features, just do it and 
should be fine ...

To use the tool you might click in icon art line, and load from the folder images a image that has the
post fixed artLine, example kagome_artLine.png ... After you should click in the icon Colorida, and load  the image kagome_color.png.

After those two steps click in the icon Processar ... You will be placed in Shader frame, you must click in he boton Calcular.
That's it ... The code is inside of folder code, which algorithm correspond to a frame that you my see in the software.
